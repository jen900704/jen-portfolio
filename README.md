## Overview

The portfolio highlights several areas of my academic and creative work:

### 1. Computational Mental Health
Projects integrating machine learning with mental health applications, including depression detection, psycholinguistic analysis, and speech-based modeling.

### 2. Speech & Language Research
Work developed across collaborations with UT Dallas, Johns Hopkins University (CLSP), and other groups.  
Focus areas include speech representation learning, affective computing, and linguistic attribution.

### 3. Trauma-Informed Counseling
Selected materials from my graduate training in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, emphasizing trauma, group process, and multicultural considerations.

### 4. Art Therapy Portfolio (Flipbook Viewer)
A complete 2023 art therapy portfolio presented through a custom React flipbook interface.  
Slides and large assets are hosted using Hugging Face Datasets for stability.
